          The idea of a cafe on the banks of our beautiful Swan River was first
          hatched on a cold and wet morning more than 20 years ago after having
          had a great row with some good mates, and thinking the only thing that
          could make this better was a warm spot with a great coffee and a good
          feed. Since then we have had a life full of adventures and another
          fulfilling career but that lingering desire to create a space where
          everyone would be welcome and where we could share this beautiful
          location has never left us.

          We have worked incredibly hard and had wonderful support from everyone
          to finally create this wonderful space that we hope you love as much
          as we do. Our goal is to create a space where everyone feels welcome
          and we provide a sense of community for everyone. Of course we love
          our coffee and food and will endeavour to bring you great tasting
          ethically sourced offerings.

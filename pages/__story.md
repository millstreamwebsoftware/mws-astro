# Our Story

I started rowing at ANA in 1996 after moving from the Fremantle rowing club and it was shortly after that I first mentioned that we should have a cafe so we could enjoy each other's company as well as the beautiful location. My wife and I bought a house about 200 meters from the rowing club in 1998 - largely because we love this bit of river and although a cafe is something I have always believed we need in that area, I ended up on another career trajectory, spending most of the last 20 years as a Paramedic.

In trying to realise this dream, I have had great support from ANA Rowing Club, City of Bayswater Council and Councillors, and also from local residents. City of Bayswater had long ago identified this location as being underutilised. In its Strategic Master Plan approximately 10 years ago, this location was marked as where it wanted a cafe. Local residents often mention that they feel the one thing we really need is a cafe in this beautiful part of the river.

Our café is a great example of community collaboration to activate an underutilised space. It will mean the rowing clubrooms are almost always open and club members will be able to use them as they always have; after hours the clubrooms will still be available to the membership. The council have been super supportive and created the opportunity for the rowing club to go into partnership with me, which will hopefully give them some increased funding as well as greater exposure to potential new members. I love rowing and don't think a lot of people are aware of how accessible it is as a sport. The blending of the club and the cafe will help promote this at least to some degree. ANA club celebrated its Centenary last year and I am determined to honour this history by maintaining the clubroom feel and history whilst making the public feel as welcome as the members.

This will be a vibrant local business, creating local jobs and supporting great Perth suppliers. We will be serving fantastic locally roasted coffee from Leftfield, delicious Gelato from Pietro Gelataria, breads from Loafers Artisan, and all of our cakes and slices will be made on site. As locals, we have seen how busy the river is from early in the morning and are planning on early opening hours so people will have the option of a great coffee and a quick bite to eat rather than feeling that they have to rush off to get ready for the day ahead.

We are very keen to be open by Spring. At this stage our main hurdle is the need for a power upgrade to the building, as the last 30 years has seen a growth in sporting clubs and amenities down at the river which means the power draw is very close to capacity. We have been working closely with the Council and are very hopeful that funding will be made available in this year's budget so we can open later in the year.

We are very excited to be bringing the café to Bayswater. At the moment, we have conditional approval for both inside and outside seating along with numerous seating opportunities along the foreshore which the council has already provided.

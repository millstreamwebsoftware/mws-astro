# Our Story

</section>

<section>
The idea of a cafe on the banks of our beautiful Swan River was first hatched on a cold and wet morning more than 20 years ago after having had a great row with some good mates, and thinking the only thing that could make this better was a warm spot with a great coffee and a good feed. Since then we have had a life full of adventures and another fulfilling career but that lingering desire to create a space where everyone would be welcome and where we could share this beautiful location has never left us.

We have worked incredibly hard and had wonderful support from everyone to finally create this wonderful space that we hope you love as much as we do. Our goal is to create a space where everyone feels welcome and we provide a sense of community for everyone. Of course we love our coffee and food and will endeavour to bring you great tasting ethically sourced offerings.
